# Motivation {background="#b2cc9b"}

## Power-law degree distributions

- The degree distributions of real-world networks are observed to follow a power law, with $p(k)\propto k^{-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma>0$.
This is not captured by simpler models such as the Erdős-Rényi model.

- The Barabási-Albert (BA) model aims to model this power law by having new nodes preferentially attach to existing nodes with higher degrees.

## Problem statement

The BA model generates power-law degree distributions with $\gamma=3$, while typically $\gamma\in(2,3)$ for real-world networks.

# Key question
**How can one modify the BA model to create power-law degree distributions with $\gamma\neq3$?**

# Main results {background="#b2cc9b"}

## The growing random network model

Consider Krapivsky et al. (2000), who characterise a generalisation of the BA model, known as the growing random network (GN) model.

## GN model definition

The GN model with connection kernel $\pi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ and initial graph $G_0$ generates a sequence of graphs $G_1,G_2,\cdots$, where given $G_t$, $G_{t+1}$ is constructed by:

1. Adding a new node to $V(G_t)$.
2. Connecting the new node via an edge to an element of $V(G_t)$, such that node $i$ is connected to with probability proportional to $\pi(d_i)$.

## The connection kernel

Krapivsky et al. (2000) focus on connection kernels of the form $\pi(k)=k^\alpha$, for $\alpha\geq 0$.
Let $\mathcal{N}_{k,t}$ be the expected number of $k$-degree nodes at time $t$.
The authors derive the rate equation
$$
\frac{d\mathcal{N}_{k,t}}{dt}=\frac{1}{M_{\alpha,t}}\left[(k-1)^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{k-1,t}-k^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{k,t}\right]+\delta_{k1},
$$
where $M_{\alpha,t}=\sum_{j=1}^\infty j^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{j,t}$ is a normalising constant and $\delta_{k1}=\mathbf{1}_{k=1}$.
This is used to derive the degree distribution of the GN model in three regimes.

## Linear regime

In this scenario, $\alpha=1$ (the BA model).
It is shown that
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty}p_t(k)=\frac{4}{k(k+1)(k+2)}\sim 4k^{-3},
$$
which is the same result from the lectures.
Additionally, when $\pi(1)=1$ and $\pi(k)=Ck$ for $k\geq2$ and $C>0$,
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty}p_t(k)\sim k^{-(3+\sqrt{1+8/C})/2}.
$$
