# Motivation {background="#b2cc9b"}

## Power-law degree distributions

- The degree distributions of real-world networks are observed to follow a power law, with $p(k)\propto k^{-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma>0$.
This is not captured by simpler models such as the Erdős-Rényi and configuration models.

- The Barabási-Albert (BA) model aims to model this power law by having new nodes preferentially attach to existing nodes with higher degrees.

## The BA model

Recall that the BA model was covered in the lectures.

## BA model definition

The BA model with $m=1$ and initial graph $G_0$ generates a sequence of graphs $G_1,G_2,\cdots$, where given $G_t$, $G_{t+1}$ is constructed by:

1. Adding a new node to $V(G_t)$.
2. Connecting the new node via an edge to an element of $V(G_t)$, such that node $i$ is connected to with probability proportional to $d_i$.

## Problem statement

The BA model generates power-law degree distributions with $\gamma=3$, while typically $\gamma\in(2,3)$ for real-world networks.

# Key question
**How can one modify the BA model to create power-law degree distributions with $\gamma\neq3$?**

# Main results {background="#b2cc9b"}

## The growing random network model

Consider Krapivsky et al. (2000), who characterise a generalisation of the BA model, known as the growing random network (GN) model.

## GN model definition

The GN model with connection kernel $\pi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ and initial graph $G_0$ generates a sequence of graphs $G_1,G_2,\cdots$, where given $G_t$, $G_{t+1}$ is constructed by:

1. Adding a new node to $V(G_t)$.
2. Connecting the new node via an edge to an element of $V(G_t)$, such that node $i$ is connected to with probability proportional to $\pi(d_i)$.

## The connection kernel

Krapivsky et al. (2000) focus on connection kernels of the form $\pi(k)=k^\alpha$, for $\alpha\geq 0$.
Let $\mathcal{N}_{k,t}$ be the expected number of $k$-degree nodes at time $t$.
The authors derive the rate equation
$$
\frac{d\mathcal{N}_{k,t}}{dt}=\frac{1}{M_{\alpha,t}}\left[(k-1)^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{k-1,t}-k^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{k,t}\right]+\delta_{k1},
$$
where $M_{\alpha,t}=\sum_{j=1}^\infty j^\alpha \mathcal{N}_{j,t}$ is a normalising constant and $\delta_{k1}=\mathbf{1}_{k=1}$.
This is used to derive the degree distribution $[\mathcal{N}_{k,t}/t]_{k=1}^\infty$ of the GN model in three regimes.

## [Sub-linear regime]{style="color: blue"}

In this scenario $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
It is shown that
\begin{align}
  &\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\mathcal{N}_{k,t}}{t}=\frac{\mu(\alpha)}{k^\alpha}\prod_{j=1}^k\left[1+\frac{\mu(\alpha)}{j^\alpha}\right]^{-1} \\
  &\stackrel{k}{\sim}
  \begin{cases}
        k^{-\alpha}\exp\left[-\mu(\alpha)\frac{k^{1-\alpha}-2^{1-\alpha}}{1- \alpha}\right] & \alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1), \\
        k^{\mu(\alpha)^2-1/2}\exp\left[-2\mu(\alpha)\sqrt{k}\right] & \alpha=\frac{1}{2}, \\
        k^{-\alpha}\exp\left[-\mu(\alpha)\frac{k^{1-\alpha}}{1-\alpha}+\frac{\mu(\alpha)^2}{2}\frac{k^{1-2\alpha}}{1-2\alpha}\right] & \alpha\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2}), \\
        \cdots
    \end{cases}
\end{align}

## [Linear regime]{style="color: green"}

In this scenario, $\alpha=1$ (the BA model).
It is shown that
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\mathcal{N}_{k,t}}{t}=\frac{4}{k(k+1)(k+2)}\sim 4k^{-3},
$$
which is the same result from the lectures.
Additionally, when $\pi(1)=1$ and $\pi(k)=Ck$ for $k\geq2$ and $C>0$,
$$
\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{\mathcal{N}_{k,t}}{t}\sim k^{-(3+\sqrt{1+8/C})/2}.
$$

## [Super-linear regime]{style="color: red"}

In this scenario, $\alpha>1$.
It is shown that:

- For $\alpha>2$, a single dominant *gel node* is directly linked with almost all of the nodes in the limit as $t\to\infty$.
- For $\alpha\in(\frac{m+1}{m},\frac{m}{m-1})$ with $m=2,3,\cdots$, $\lim_{t\to\infty}\sum_{k=m+1}^\infty\mathcal{N}_{k,t}<\infty$, while $\mathcal{N}_{k,t}\stackrel{t}{\sim}t^{k-(k-1)\alpha}$ for $1\leq k\leq m$.

In both cases, $\lim_{t\to\infty}\mathcal{N}_{k,t}/t=\mathbf{1}_{k=1}.$

## Summary

- In the [**sub-linear regime**]{style="color: blue"} where $\alpha\in(0,1)$, the limiting degree distribution decays according to a stretched exponential.
- In the [**linear regime**]{style="color: green"} where $\alpha=1$, the limiting degree distribution decays according to a power law, the negative exponent of which can be adjusted to any $\gamma>2$.
- In the [**super-linear regime**]{style="color: red"} where $\alpha>1$, the limiting degree distribution concentrates about $k=1$ with mass one, and has no upper tail.
